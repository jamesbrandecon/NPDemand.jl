    define_problem(df::DataFrame; exchange = [], index_vars = ["prices"], FE = [], constraints = [], bO = 2, tol = 1e-5)

Constructs a `problem`::NPDProblem using the provided problem characteristics. Inputs: 

- `exchange`: A vector of groups of products which are exchangeable. E.g., with 4 goods, if the first
and second are exchangeable and so are the third and fourth, set `exchange` = [[1 2], [3 4]].
- `index_vars`: String array listing column names in `df` which represent variables that enter the inverted index.
    - "prices" must be the first element of `index_vars`
- `FE`: String array listing column names in `df` which should be included as fixed effects.
    - Note: All fixed effects are estimated as parameters by the minimizer, so be careful adding fixed effects for variables that take many values.
- `bO`: Order of the univariate Bernstein polynomials in market shares. Default is 2.
- `constraint_tol`: Tolerance specifying tightness of constraints
- `chunk_size`: Controls chunk size in ForwardDiff.Gradient autodiff calculation for nonlinear constraints. Only used if :subs\\_in\\_group specified. 
- `constraints`: A list of symbols of accepted constraints. Currently supported constraints are: 
    - :monotone  
    - :all_substitutes 
    - :diagonal\\_dominance\\_group 
    - :diagonal\\_dominance\\_all 
    - :subs\\_in\\_group (Note: this constraint is the only available nonlinear constraint and will slow down estimation considerably)
- `verbose`: if `false`, will not print updates as problem is generated
